# What is Concentration?
Concentration is a memory game where you have facedown cards with different symbols on them. The goal is to turn 2 face-up at a time and remembering where each symbol is in order to match it.

# How to Play
Simply press "Start Game" to generate the game board. After that, you have 6 attempts to match the 4 pairs. Correct attempts do not count towards the 6 attempt limit. If you use up all 6 attempts, you lose the game. If you match all, you win!
